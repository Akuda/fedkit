# FEDkit-legacy

This is based off an unreleased workflow I used to use. However, it has been streamlined & updated with some modern technologies:

* Grunt 0.4
* Assemble 0.4
* LibSass 3.1
* MQ SASS

This project is undocumented and not really meant for public consumption but feel free to use it if it is useful. Project is currently running only on master branch, marked as a private package & untagged for now.

The 'Proper' FedKit is coming in the future with documentation and much more jazzy stuff.
