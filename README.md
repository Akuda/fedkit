# FEDkit-legacy

This is based off an unreleased workflow I used to use. However, it has been streamlined & updated with some modern technologies:

* Grunt 0.4.x
* Assemble 0.4.x
* Libsass 3.1
* SASS-MQ 3.1.2
* Singularity.gs 1.6.2

This project is undocumented and not really meant for public consumption but feel free to use it if it is useful.

The 'Proper' FedKit is coming in the future with documentation and much more jazzy stuff.

NOTE: Singularity.gs warns about Breakpoint being missing on compile but it's not a problem. SASS-MQ is far better anyway.
